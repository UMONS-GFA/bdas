  * 2015-05-05 
    * 09:00 UTC - unable to download from serial connection on nanoDAS R009 : "pas de bloc de date" / 
    * 9:30 UTC - replaced nanoDAS R009 RTC battery - synchronized RTC and reset (#ZR) nanoDAS R009 / replaced nanoDAS R002 RTC battery / 
    * 10:00 UTC - nanoDAS R002 clock reads 10:28:30 - synchronized nanoDAS R002 RTC / Full download from serial connection on nanoDAS R002 : OK / nanoDAS R007 is not responding from serial connection / replaced nanoDAS R007 RTC battery / 
    * 10:30 UTC - nanoDAS R001 clock reads 11:12:00 / nanoDAS R001 sends garbage from serial connection with a cut cable (yellow : GND, blue : RTS, brown : TX, red : RX); when GND of cable is disconnected sends a leading 0x00 with every line (e.g. \0x00 !2015 05 05 10 30 21) and sending commands doesn't work / replaced nanoDAS R001 RTC battery
/ replaced nanoDAS R010 RTC battery / replaced nanoDAS R010 RS232 cable to USC / checked connection on edas2 : OK /   
     * 13:58 UTC - nanoDAS R010 clock reads 14:45 UTC - synchronized nanoDAS R010 RTC / Ethernet connection - replaced ethernet switch near the Quanterra and ethernet cable in enclosure#06 / replaced ORB RS232-RS422 linked to nanoDAS R001 with USC / connected to edas1 / connected edas1 branch (nanoDAS R009, nanoDAS R001, nanoDAS R002 and nanoDAS R007) to USC connected to nanoDAS R012 / checked communication with nanoDAS R001, nanoDAS R002, nanoDAS R007, nanoDAS R009 and  nanoDAS R012 : OK / replaced nanoDAS R013 RTC battery (OK, CB, AW) / Updated client2.py to allow for 'host' and port arguments (v2.12) (OK) / checked running connection with host on both ports (edas2 on BB : port XXXX1; edas1 on PC with remserial : port XXXX4) : connection on port XXXX1 sucessful, port XXXX4 not opened yet (OK)
* April
  * 2015-04-24 - replaced ORB RS232-RS422 interfaces with USC on nanoDAS R010 / connected nanoDAS R010 to edas2 (AW). To be fixed : Ground cable disconnected from RS232 adaptor.
  * 2015-04-09 - Installed BB in the cave at the end of edas2 RS-485 network (OK, AW) / replaced ORB RS232-RS422 interfaces on nanoDAS R012 and at the end of edas1 with USCs connected to PC running remserial (not connected to the local network yet) / reconditioned nanoDAS R012 (OK)
* January
  * 2015-01-29 - Tested updated BB firmware with USC using raw TCP in BB settings : seems OK, doesn't repeat FF anymore
