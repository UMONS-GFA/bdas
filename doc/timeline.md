* April
  * 2015-04-24 - replaced ORB RS232-RS422 interfaces with USC on nanoDAS R010 / connected nanoDAS R010 to edas2 (AW). To be fixed : Ground cable disconnected from RS232 adaptor.
  * 2015-04-09 - Installed BB in the cave at the end of edas2 RS-485 network (OK/AW) / replaced ORB RS232-RS422 interfaces on nanoDAS R012 and at the end of edas1 with USCs connected to PC running remserial (not connected to the local network yet) / reconditioned nanoDAS R012 (OK)
* January
  * 2015-01-29 - Tested updated BB firmware with USC using raw TCP in BB settings : seems OK, doesn't repeat FF anymore
